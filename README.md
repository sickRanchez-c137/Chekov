# Chekov
Chekov is a reader and a writer. He reads some stories, learns how to write stories and writes some cool stories. In summary, Chekov write stories, much like the great Anton Chekov from whom he is inspired from.

## Anatomy
Chekov contains two parts. 
* Research Part: This is implemented in [chekov_gettext.py](chekov_gettext.py), performs research. This means, Chekov goes to market and brings the books to read. All the books to reads are placed in new folder created.
* Read and Write Part: This is implemented in [chekov_main.py](chekov_main.py). Chekov reads the stories that he searched from research, learns how to write new stories and writes one new story based on his knowledge.

## Usage
Please run the script chekov_gettext.py to generate a set of texts for Chekov to read. If you alredy have the stories in your disposal, you can modify the code accordingly in chekov_main.py and not worry about running chekov_gettext.py.

## Sample Output
Although Chekov holds the potential to learn from as many texts as possible and can spit as long story as we want, the initial test is performed with a single story which is written by Anton Chekov. Our Chekov will write the story of 10K characters. The first output will be posted soon.
